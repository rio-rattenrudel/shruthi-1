Shruthi-1 - MOD
=======================
## Preamble

This fork contains minor modifications to the original shruthi (1.03) Master Branch. The customizations are compatible with the original version, lies in the branch 'original'. All changes in the source are uniformly marked with beginning and ending comment.

## Modifications

1. [SEQ Handling - External BPM](https://github.com/rio-rattenrudel/shruthi-1/commit/aec0904e4ff012a145512ef84a24a13eba4a4901)

Sequences operated by external BPM should behave like driven by internal BPM. That is, sequences are controlled by NOTE On/Off, but the external tempo is used. 
Furthermore, the 12 ticks delay was removed, which otherwise can not be programmed exactly.

## Original Notes

Shruthi-1, a digital/analog hybrid MIDI monosynth.

This project is a redesign of the original Shruti-1, with a spec'ed up CPU,
and a focus on easy upgrades/modification of the analog section.
The ATMega644p allows new features in the firmware -- a larger selection of
oscillator algorithms, a bigger selection of wavetables, and a tiny sequencer.
